Starting Wes Bos's Javascript 30 days of challenges from here : [JavaScript30](https://javascript30.com/)

# Day 1: JavaScript Drump Kit : Completed
I tried to recreate the starter files using CSS GRID for practice, and used deep house drum samples instead of the samples provided. House drum beats were taken from [Soundpacks](https://soundpacks.com/free-sound-packs/deep-house-drum-samples/).

# Day 2: CSS+ JS clock: Completed
Recreated the starter files from scratch and solved the issue with clock hands rewinding to starting position at zero sec/min/hour
