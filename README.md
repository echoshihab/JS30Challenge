Starting Wes Bos's Javascript 30 days of challenges from here : [JavaScript30](https://javascript30.com/)

Goal is to recreate the start files from scratch to experiment and get comfortable with CSS GRID + Flex and try to add slight modifications to the projects

# Day 1: JavaScript Drum Kit : Completed
Recreated starter files, and used deep house drum samples instead of the samples provided. House drum beats were taken from [Soundpacks](https://soundpacks.com/free-sound-packs/deep-house-drum-samples/).

# Day 2: CSS+ JS clock: Completed
Recreated starter files and solved the issue with clock hands rewinding to starting position at zero sec/min/hour

# Day 3: CSS Variables + JS: Completed
Recreated the starter files from scratch and solved the problem

# Day 4: Array Cardio 1 : Completed
I used the starter files for this javascript only exercise.
