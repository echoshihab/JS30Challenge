Starting Wes Bos's Javascript 30 days of challenges from here : [JavaScript30](https://javascript30.com/)

Goal is to recreate the start files from scratch to experiment and get comfortable with CSS GRID + Flex and try to add slight modifications to the projects

### Day 1: JavaScript Drum Kit : Completed
Recreated starter files, and used deep house drum samples instead of the samples provided. House drum beats were taken from [Soundpacks](https://soundpacks.com/free-sound-packs/deep-house-drum-samples/).

### Day 2: CSS+ JS clock: Completed
Recreated starter files + solved the issue with clock hands rewinding to starting position at zero sec/min/hour

### Day 3: CSS Variables + JS: Completed
Recreated the starter files + solved the problem

### Day 4: Array Cardio 1 : Completed
the starter files for this javascript only exercise.

### Day 5: Flex Panels Gallery: Completed
Recreated starter files + Solved challenge (used background colors instead of images for panels)

### Day 6: Ajax type ahead: Completed
Completed this excercise with pokemon data instead. I used JSON data from - [Pokedex] (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fanzeyi/pokemon.json/master/pokedex.json) . Completed the exercise with slighltly modified logic since the data I used had nested arrays.

### Day 7:Array Cardio 2: Completed
Used the starter files for this javascript only exercise

### Day 8: Fun with HTML5 Canvas: Completed
Recreated starter files + solved the challenge

### Day 9: Dev tools domination: Completed
Followed along Wes Bos's video for this day and explored dev tools

### Day 10: Hold shift to select multiple checkboxes
Recreated starter files + solved the challenge on my own first (mysolution.js). Worked through this solution again with Wes Bos's much cleaner solution (wbsolution.js)

### Day 11: Custom HTML Video player
Recreated starter files + Solved the challenge. Watched the video after and implemented the scrub function, refactored the slider logic and displaying play vs pause button.

### Day 12: Key Sequence Detection
Challenge solved!

### Day 13: Slide in on the scroll
Worked along with Wes Bos on this one. I found the debounce functions confusing, and found a good resource here
https://john-dugan.com/javascript-debounce/ that gives a step by step breakdown of the debounce function.

### Day 14: Object and Arrays - Reference vs Copy
Worked along with Wes Bos, learned that copying an object is only one level deep, and learned the poor man's deep clone method

### Day 15: Local Storage and Event Delegation
Watched the video and attempted this on my own, going back to videos where I had problem with event delegation. Also solved
the challenges Wes Bos provided at the end

### Day 16: Mouse Move shadow
Watched the completed solution and attempted this on my own. Completed text shadow effect, but it looked glitchy. After watching the video, I added the event listener to parent element instead of document and made sure the inside elment didn't interfere with pixel measurements
following  Wes's logic.

### Day 17: Sorted Band names with Articles
Was able to solve this challenge on my own. Ran into a bit of a problem trying to add to much to the sort function. Separating the function to deal with the articles was the key to the solution.

### Day 18: Add up times with reduce
used the provided starter file and was able to solve this on my own with map and reduce

### Day 19: Fun with Webcam
worked along wes bos for this challenge. Had to make a minor change and replace the now depreciated createObjectURL syntax with srcObject (see - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URL/createObjectURL)
