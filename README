Starting Wes Bos's Javascript 30 days of challenges from here : [JavaScript30](https://javascript30.com/)

## Day 1: JavaScript Drump Kit : Completed
Modification I made: I tried to recreate the starter files using CSS GRID for practice, and used deep house drum samples instead of the samples provided.
House drum beats were taken from [Soundpacks](https://soundpacks.com/free-sound-packs/deep-house-drum-samples/)
